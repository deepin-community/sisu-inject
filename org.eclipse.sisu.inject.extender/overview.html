<h1>Overview</h1>
Sisu is a modular <a href="http://atinject.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/javax/inject/package-summary.html">JSR330</a>-based container that supports classpath scanning, auto-binding, and dynamic auto-wiring.
<p><p>
Sisu uses <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/">Google-Guice</a> to perform dependency injection and provide the core JSR330 support, but removes the need to write explicit bindings in Guice modules.
<p><p>
This bundle contains a BundleActivator that maintains a dynamic injector graph by scanning bundles as they come and go.
